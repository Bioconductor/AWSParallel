# Introduction

The AWSParallel package provides functionality to perform parallel evaluation using AWS infrastructure, specifically EC2. It extends the `SnowParam` class in BiocParallel, and works with Bioconductor objects.

The main idea behind the AWSParallel package is allow the user to create a cluster of EC2 machines on AWS, and run `bplapply` from one "master" node(EC2 machine) to send a task to "worker" machines.

This package requires that the user have an Amazon AWS account that *costs money*, and requires a credit card to access. The AWS credentials provided by the user also need access, to other AWS services as well, namely, 

    1. IAM
    2. VPC
    3. EC2

# Quick Start

The quick start guide assumes you have your AWS access key, and secret key in `~/.aws/credentials`. Please refer to the detailed guide if not.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(AWSParallel)
workers = 2

## bioc-release 3.6
image <-  "ami-7d342906"

## A AWS Key pair created and downloaded via AWS.
awsSshKeyPair = "~/.ssh/path_to_key.pem"

aws <- AWSSnowParam(
    workers=workers,
    awsInstanceType="t2.micro",  ## Launch a small instance for demonstration 
    awsAmiId= image,
    awsSshKeyPair = awsSshKeyPair
    ## TODO: This should be removed. As installing on AMI, this should be default.
    ##     bplib="/home/ubuntu/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/BiocParallel"
)

## Start instance
bpstart(aws)

## Start an AWSParam job-
## Notice that the hostnames are different. We can run a computation now, and 
## the job gets spread across the different machines, and collected back into
## the variable xx.
xx <- bplapply(1:4, function(i) system("hostname", intern=TRUE), BPPARAM=aws)

## Stop aws instance
bpstop(aws) 
```


# AWS settings

Settings required to get the package working on AWS.

## Get AWS Credntials

To use AWSParallel, AWS credentials are a requirement. The credentials are given through [AWS Identity and Access management - IAM][]. The user needs an AWS access key and secret key.

These AWS credntials should be stored on your machine accessible at `~/.aws/credentials`, as given in the documentation for [configuring AWS credentials][].

Example AWS credentials, which need to be in the file, "~/.aws/credentials".


    [default]
    aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
    aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY


The AWS credentials provided to the package need access to a few components of the AWS account,

1. IAM - This is used to get the credentials, change credentials, activate/deactivate credentials
        for security reasons.
1. VPC - This is used to detect VPC's in the region, so that all the instances launched are within
        the same VPC, and same subnet.
1. EC2 - This is used to launch, run, and terminate instances as needed. 

## AWS Key Pair

User's also need to create a KeyPair which needs to be accessible on the machine being used. The Key Pair can be created using the [AWS-EC2 interface][].

It can also be done programmatically using the `AWSParallel` package but the functionality is imported from `aws.ec2`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(AWSParallel)
## Use credentials in your ~/.aws/crentials file
aws.signature::use_credentials()
## This saves the `.pem` file in your your path ~/AWSParallel-keypair.pem
aws.ec2::create_keypair(keypair = "AWSParallel-key", path="~/AWSParallel-keypair.pem")

## Key pair to be passed in to your AWSSnowParam class
awsSshKeyPair = "~/AWSParallel-keypair.pem"
```

## VPC and Subnet (Optional)

Every AWS account has a default *VPC* created when the account is started. This VPC is usually contained to one AWS Region. Most of the Bioconductor AMI's are located on the *AWS-Region US-EAST*, so starting your account with a VPC located in that region makes most sense.

If the VPC is created(by the user or amazon default), the account gets *Subnets* as well by default. For the `AWSSnowParam` class to be created, the user has to specify the Subnet. If the subnet is not given, we use, the first one on the AWS account. 

*NOTE:* The *master* instance and the *worker* instances need to be on the same VPC and subnet with permissible security groups. Without this the socket connection established with other machines launched on AWS does not work well.

## Security Group settings (Optional)

Security groups are probably the most important AWS setting required in AWSParallel. It's easier if

Once you have the following AWS components set up, you are ready to use the package

# Working with the package AWSParallel

We need to launch the Bioconductor AMI for the *release* version.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

## Load the package
library(AWSParallel)

## bioc-release 3.6 as found in https://www.bioconductor.org/config.yaml
image <-  "ami-7d342906"

## Number of workers to be started in the AWS cluster
workers = 4

## Set the AWS SSH key pair for your machine, or
## If you already have a keypair, just set the path_to_key, to the pem file.
path_to_key = "~/aws-parallel.pem"

TODO: This can also be automated
awsSshKeyPair = aws.ec2::create_keypair("AWSParallelKeyPair", path_to_key)

## 
sg <- "sg-748dcd07"
subnet <- "subnet-d66a05ec"

## Create AWS instance
aws <- AWSSnowParam(
    workers=workers,
    awsInstanceType="t2.micro",
    awsSubnet = subnet,
    awsSecurityGroup = sg,
    awsAmiId= image,
    awsSshKeyPair = path_to_key,
    bplib="/home/ubuntu/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/BiocParallel",
    awsCredentialsPath="/home/ubuntu/credentials"
    )

aws
## Check if instance is up,
awsInstanceStatus(aws)

## Start instance
bpstart(aws)

## Return cluster which was started
awsCluster()

## Check is instance is up
awsInstanceStatus(aws)

## start an AWSParam job
bplapply(1:4, function(i) system("hostname", intern=TRUE), BPPARAM=aws)

## Stop aws instance
bpstop(aws)
```

# Choosing AWS EC2 Instance Size



# Steps

1. Create a new amazon EC2 instance which is going to be the *master* node, by choosing the AMI-ID from this page, http://bioconductor.org/help/bioconductor-cloud-ami/#ami_ids. Follow the steps in the ec2 management console to launch the image.
An instance with the size of `t2.micro` is also accepatble for the *master* node.

1. SSH into the instance, which will be
